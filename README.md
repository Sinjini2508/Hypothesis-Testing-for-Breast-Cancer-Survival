Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing


## About the dataset
Title: Haberman’s Survival Data

Description: The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Attribute Information:

-- Age of patient at the time of operation (numerical)

-- Patient’s year of operation (year — 1900, numerical)

-- Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)

-- Survival status (class attribute) :
 1 => the patient survived 5 years or longer
 2 => the patient died within 5 years
 
 
## Aim:
 - To do exploratory data analysis to understand the features of the dataset and to find out any correlation between the features 
 - To conduct hypothesis testing to find out the most important factors that determine the survival of a breast cancer patient
 
 ## Conclusion:
From the exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, we conclude that age and number of nodes are the two most significant factors that affect patient survival rate. The year in which the operation was performed does not have a statistically significant impact.

However, it cannot be guaranteed that the result of this data analysis will hold true in the real world because the dataset we used in this analysis was highly imbalanced. Also, the number of features was only three, namely: Age, Number of nodes and Year of Operation. Patient survival rates might be influenced by a number of other factors, which could have been included as features in the dataset.
